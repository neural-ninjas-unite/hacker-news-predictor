There were 157 bank failures in the U.S. in 2010, and another 140 in 2009.<p>Those depositors with FDIC-insured accounts did not lose a dime in these bank failures. Those who rolled the dice and exceeded the $250K limit, well, who knows what happened to their money.",2160557,"{2164488}",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

When Apple put iPads in the stores, everyone paid attention and took for granted it was something potentially great.  Samsung has no credibility, so they are fighting against the tablet novelty and a huge history of ""me-too"" devices put out to compete with Apple.  (I'm thinking of the ""iPhone competitor"" phones many companies put out that were nothing but cell phones with a color interface, a gimmicky touch screen, some horrid interface for playing mp3s, and a crippled browser.)<p>Ordinary consumers will not feel comfortable buying non-Apple tablets until they have a better idea what a tablet actually is and how to shop for one.",2162634,"{2162959,2163076,2163532,2162865}",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Very little has ever happened, quickly erased by further complexification.<p>(Broadly speaking, they're doing it wrong. The solution to a too-complicated tax code is to fix the incentives Congress has to make a complicated tax code, then let the problem address itself incrementally over several years. Simply burning straight for simplication without addressing the underlying problems is doomed to failure. Of course, trying to address the underlying problems is also mostly doomed to failure, so <i>shrug</i>.)",2162526,"{2163065,2163444}",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
